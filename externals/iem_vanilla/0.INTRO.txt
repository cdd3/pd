------------- gui (included into millers pd) --------------------
polar_diagram_500r    circular display of level over angle, zero degree at thr right

-------------------- symbol operating -------------------------
symbol_merge	 merges a list of symbols and floats to a symbol, 
		   connected by a separator symbol character (default: "")
symbol_slice	 divides a symbol into a list of symbols, separation point is a certain symbol character
symbol_split	 divides a symbol into a left and a right part, dividing position is the n-th character.
splitfilename	 split an incoming symbol into path and filename (separator is the most right "/")
		   or split the symbol at the n-th character position

------------------- list operating ------------------------
list_from_r	   receive-name-symbol will be prepended to the received message and sent to output
list_get_atoms	   extract a sublist of atoms from a list
list_merge	   convert a serial stream of atoms into a list
list_remove_atoms  delete a sublist of atoms of a list
list_replace_atoms replace a sublist of atoms of a list
list_reverse	   exchange the order of the atoms of a list from begin to end
list_rev_merge	   convert a serial stream of atoms into a reverse list
list_rev_slice	   convert a list into a reverse serial stream of atoms
list_rotate	   shifts the list n times to the left or to the right and feeds the input with the released atom
list_slice	   convert a list into a serial stream of atoms
list_sort	   sort a list and its sorting indices
list_sort2	   sort a list and its sorting indices and sorts a second list in this way
list_to_s	   the selector symbol of an incomming message will be used for sending the residual part of the message

-------------------------- misc -------------------------------

nop		 no operation, adds a vertex to a message cord
once		 any message pass through only the first time
speedlim	 speed limit for anything messages

-------------------- table operating  -------------------------
tab2list	 retrieve a certain range of the table content and put out as a list
tabread2	 read numbers from a table with 2-point interpolation
tabsize		 read or change the size of a table
