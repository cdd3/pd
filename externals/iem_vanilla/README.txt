This library extends the performance of Miller S. Puckette's 
realtime-computermusic-environment puredata (pd).

iem_vanilla contains 66 abstractions and their help files (see CONTENT.txt).
The main topics are to support pd with useful objects of the iemlib without a need of compieled dynamic libraries.

iem_vanilla is published under the Gnu Lesser General Public License 
  (see LICENSE.txt and GnuLGPL.txt).

iem_vanilla (Release 1.00) is written by Thomas Musil from IEM KUG Graz Austria
 and it needs pd-0.50-0 and greater.

You have to add the path -path "install_path"/iem_vanilla (Menue: File: Preferences: Path...: New...).

  For Windows "install_path" could be:
"C:/Users/xx_ME_xx/AppData/Roaming/Pd" or
"C:/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Pd" or
"C:/Users/xx_ME_xx/Documents/Pd/externals" or
"C:/Program Files (x86)/pd/extra".

  For Apple OSX: "install_path" could be:
"~/Library/Pd" or
"/Library/Pd" or
"/Applications/Pd.app/Contents/Resources/extra".

  For Linux: "install_path" could be:
"~/.local/lib/pd/extra" or
"~/pd-externals" or
"/usr/local/lib/pd-externals" or
"/usr/local/lib/pd/extra" or
"/usr/lib/pd/extra".

Make sure that you get the desired version of iem_vanilla if there are multiple installations on your computer (-verbose).
