This library extends the performance of Miller S. Puckette's 
realtime-computermusic-environment puredata (pd).

iemgui contains 1 external library
(iemgui.m_i386 for Windows XP/8/9/10 for Pd-32-Bit; iemgui.m_amd64 for Windows XP/8/9/10 for Pd-64-Bit; 
 iemgui.pd_darwin for OSX_10.6++; iemgui.pd_linux for Linux) with 11 objects and their
help files (see CONTENT.txt). The main topic is to support pd with more Graphical User Interface objects.

iemgui is published under the Gnu Lesser General Public License 
  (see LICENSE.txt and GnuLGPL.txt).

iemgui (Release 1.21) is written by Thomas Musil from IEM KUG Graz Austria
 and it is compiled against pd-0.49-0.

You have to add the library -lib iemgui (Menue: File: Preferences: Startup...: New...).

  For Windows "install_path" could be:
"C:/Users/xx_ME_xx/AppData/Roaming/Pd" or
"C:/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Pd" or
"C:/Users/xx_ME_xx/Documents/Pd/externals" or
"C:/Program Files (x86)/pd/extra".

  For Apple OSX: "install_path" could be:
"~/Library/Pd" or
"/Library/Pd" or
"/Applications/Pd.app/Contents/Resources/extra".

  For Linux: "install_path" could be:
"~/.local/lib/pd/extra" or
"~/pd-externals" or
"/usr/local/lib/pd-externals" or
"/usr/local/lib/pd/extra" or
"/usr/lib/pd/extra".

Make sure that you get the desired version of iemgui if there are multiple installations on your computer (-verbose).
